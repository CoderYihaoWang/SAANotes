# AWS Fundamentals: IAM & EC2

## AWS Regions and AZs

- **Regions**: clusters of data centers
- Most AWS services are region-scoped
- **AZ (Availability Zones)**: Each region has many AZs.
- Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- Isolated to avoid disasters.
- Connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.
